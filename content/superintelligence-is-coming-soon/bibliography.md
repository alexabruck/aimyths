Here are some resources on the topics of AGI & Superintelligence. We've provided some general discussions of the topics, some more speculative and optimistic pieces, and a list of critical pieces. We've also provided some resources on the Turing Test/Imitation game.

##General discussions on AGI/Superintelligence

[Everything you need to know about AGI](https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2020/05/18/what-is-artificial-general-intelligence-general-ai-agi-syndication/)
- Also check out the rest of [Ben Dickinson’s blog series on demystifying AI](https://bdtechtalks.com/tag/demystifying-ai/)

2. [Wall-E syndrome](https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2020/01/23/a-beginners-guide-to-the-ai-apocalypse-wall-e-syndrome/)
3. [Artificial stupidity](https://thenextweb.com/neural/2020/07/17/a-beginners-guide-to-the-ai-apocalypse-artificial-stupidity/)

A classic paper on the idea of artificial general intelligence is:
Pei Wang - [On defining artificial intelligence](https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/jagi/10/2/article-p1.xml?language=en)
- For an excellent and clear-headed discussion of the Wang's classic paper, and more broadly on aritificial general intelligence, check out the Journal of Artificial Intelligence' [*Special Issue “On Defining Artificial Intelligence” Volume 11 (2020): Issue 2 (Feb 2020)*](https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/jagi/11/2/jagi.11.issue-2.xml).
- This special issue contains many insightful discussions of the topic, free of the type of hype that we find in many other places.

[Roman V. Yampolskiy - Human ≠ AGI](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2007/2007.07710.pdf)
> Terms Artificial  General  Intelligence (AGI)  and Human-Level  Artificial  Intelligence (HLAI) have been used interchangeably to refer to the Holy Grail of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, creation  of  a  machine  capable  of  achieving  goals  in  a  wide  range  of  environments.  However, widespread implicit assumption of equivalence between capabilities of AGI and HLAI appears to be  unjustified,  as  humans  are  not  general  intelligences.  In  this  paper,  we  will  prove  this distinction.

##Arguments/speculations for AGI/Superintelligence
For Nick Bostrom's classic discussion of the paperclip maximizer thought experiment, see this paper:
- Nick Bostrom - [Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence](https://nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai.html)
- or his book: [Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies)

For a philosophically rigorous discussion of superintelligence, the Singularity etc., check out David Chalmers' papers on the topic:
- [Chalmers' papers on AI & computation](http://consc.net/ai-and-computation/)
- In particular, his paper: [The Singularity: A Philosophical Analysis](http://consc.net/papers/singularity.pdf)

K. Eric Drexler also has an interesting and relatively sober take on how superintelligence could emerge in this paper:
[Reframing Superintelligence: Comprehensive AI Services as General Intelligence](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Reframing_Superintelligence_FHI-TR-2019-1.1-1.pdf)
- Here is a podcast appearance with Dexler where he discusses the ideas from the paper: https://futureoflife.org/2019/04/11/an-overview-of-technical-ai-alignment-with-rohin-shah-part-1/ 
- And a review of the paper: https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/08/27/book-review-reframing-superintelligence/

- Good example of the mixing of today's applications with sci-fi speculations leading to a confused article:
- "It is very difficult to predict how AI technology will develop in the future or whether it will ever become fully conscious like humans...Although artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly popular, no one knows how far it can actually evolve, and although some people believe that it will become fully aware of our super-species, others believe that this is not possible and that AI will only support humans in the future."
