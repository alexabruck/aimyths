1. What are the unintended consequences of designing systems at scale based on existing patterns in society?
2. When and how should AI systems prioritize individuals over society, and vice versa?
3. When is introducing an AI system the right answer—and when is it not?

###Dubious and pseudoscientific claims in AI
First, we've got some general resources on the problem, and then some specific resources on AI and racist pseudoscience, emotion detection, gender detection:
