###Alternatives to inappropriate and terrible robots

If you're looking for pictures of real robots to accompany an article that's *actually* about robotics, one cool resource is the ABOT database: http://abotdatabase.info/collection
Here you can find pictures and information about real, existing, humanoid robots.

For a thorough analysis of robot pictures, and representation of AI in general, check out [Is Seeing Believing](https://www.sciartmagazine.com/perception-is-seeing-believing.html), from Anne Trouillet Rogers and Lisa Talia Moretti. Not only do they provide an insightful and comprehensive anaylsis of existing representations, they also challenged a number of artists to propose alternatives.
