We've also put together a list of sources for some of the most common arguments we hear in debates about AI and agency. 


### For assigning more agency to AI
- *Given the rate of AI advancement, we need to address necessary changes that need to be made to the current IP system.*
  - [Toni Nijm, chief strategy officer for CPA Global](https://www.verdict.co.uk/dabus-ai-can-ai-invent/)
- *AI should be given legal personhood because AI decision-making processes are too difficult to understand.*
  - [Europe divided over robot ‘personhood’](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-divided-over-robot-ai-artificial-intelligence-personhood/)
      - Arguing in favor of AI personhood is related to the “black box” narrative (AI decision-making process are difficult to understand, so litigators cannot attribute legal responsibility for problems)
- *AI systems should be given legal personhood to reflect its role.*
  - [Hey Watson, Can I Sue You for Malpractice? Examining the Liability of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?)abstract_id=3076576
      - Explores whether AI’s ability to adapt and learn means that it has the capacity to reason and whether this means that AI should be considered a legal person.
      - Concludes that medical AI should be given a unique legal status akin to personhood to reflect its current and potential role in the medical decision-making process.
      - Differentiates medical AI from AI used in other products.
- *Denying agency to AI rests on unjustified 'human supremacy'
   - [Human Supremacy as Posthuman Risk](https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/sociotechnicalcritique/vol1/iss1/5/)

### Against assigning more agency to AI
- *Granting patents to AI systems raises accountability concerns.*
   - [Moral Crumple Zones: Cautionary Tales in Human-Robot Interaction](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2757236)
   - [European Commission’s ethics guidelines](https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ai-alliance-consultation)
      - - “Trustworthy AI” includes human agency and oversight. Developers must put in mechanisms that ensure responsibility and accountability.
   - [When machines create: Should AI be recognised as an inventor?](https://www.verdict.co.uk/dabus-ai-can-ai-invent/)
      - “According to Joe Michael, principal technology evangelist at AI company IPsoft, deciding to issue a patent to an AI system could raise ethical concerns, particularly around accountability.”
   - [Accountability of AI Under the Law: The Role of Explanation](https://papers-ssrn-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3064761)
      - Focus on explanation in terms of increasing accountability in AI systems.
   - [Open Letter to the European Commission Artificial Intelligence and Robotics](https://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RoboticsOpenLetter.pdf)
      - Expresses concern about the proposal to create legal personhood for robots.
      - The creation of a Legal Status of an “electronic person” for “autonomous”, “unpredictable” and “self-learning” robots is justified by the incorrect affirmation that damage liability would be impossible to prove.
   - [AI and robots should not be attributed legal personhood](https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/opinion/ai-and-robots-should-not-be-attributed-legal-personhood/)
      - Argues that responsibility must rest with people.
   - [AI in patent law: Enabler or hindrance?](https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/11/ai-in-patent-law-enabler-or-hindrance/)

- *AI capabilities are overrated.*
   - [Open Letter to the European Commission Artificial Intelligence and Robotics](https://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RoboticsOpenLetter.pdf)
      - From a technical perspective, this statement offers many bias based on an overvaluation of the actual capabilities of even the most advanced robots, a superficial understanding of unpredictability and self-learning capacities and, a robot perception distorted by Science-Fiction and a few recent sensational press announcements.
   - [Europe divided over robot ‘personhood’](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-divided-over-robot-ai-artificial-intelligence-personhood/)
      - The controversy masks the reality that robots capable of human-like intelligence and decision-making remain a far-off prospect.
- *AI personhood is already present, so creating additional concepts of personhood for AI complicates things.*
   - [The EU is right to refuse legal personality for Artificial Intelligence”](https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/opinion/the-eu-is-right-to-refuse-legal-personality-for-artificial-intelligence/)
      -The power to determine who is a “person” lies within the member states, not the EU.
      - AI persons are already here (e.g., Shawn Bayern’s analysis), so additional “electronic personality” should not be established.
      - It is premature to introduce AI personhood.
   - [Appropriateness and feasibility of legal personhood for AI systems](https://users.cs.fiu.edu/~markaf/doc/w16.zevenbergen.2018.procicres.3.x_camera.pdf)
      - The scope of AI is still ill-defined.
      - The potential economic efficiencies and distribution of gains is uncertain.
      - The ability of existing legal structures to achieve similar ends have not been sufficiently analyzed.
      - Ex. Strict product liability, vicarious liability
      - The moral requirements for personhood have not yet been met.
      - It is not yet possible to assess the social concerns arising from AIs that are indistinguishable from humans.
      - Advantages and disadvantages of AI personhood.
      - Conditions for AI personhood: technological, economic, legal, moral conditions should be met
- *Giving robots citizenship erodes human rights.*
   - [Robot Rights? Let's Talk about Human Welfare Instead](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05046)
      - Argues that a focus on esoteric ideas such as robot rights distracts energy from more important and immediate concerns such as human rights violations
   - [A misdirected application of AI ethics](https://www.noemamag.com/a-misdirected-application-of-ai-ethics/)
      - "If we look at AI as it exists today, we see a situation with altogether different ethical concerns that have to do with the undemocratic distribution of power: who gets to use AI, who is merely a passive recipient of it, who is suppressed or marginalized by it. In the current reality of AI, a call for robot rights becomes perverse — amounting to arguing for more rights and less accountability for tech companies. So, let’s not talk about hypothetical robots. Let’s talk about Siri, Nest, Roomba and the algorithms used by Google, Amazon, Facebook and others. "
      - "The dominant futurist sci-fi conception of AI conceals ubiquitous and insidious existing AI hiding in plain sight. While waiting for human-like robots, we forget to notice AI that has already morphed into the background of our day-to-day life."
      - "Giving rights to robotic and AI systems allows responsibility and accountability for machine-induced injustices orchestrated by powerful corporations to evaporate. In other words, giving rights to robotic systems amounts to extending the rights of tech developers and corporations to control, surveil and dehumanize mass populations. Big tech monopolies already master the art of avoiding responsibility and accountability by spending millions of dollars on lobbying to influence regulations, through ambiguous and vague language and various other loopholes. Treating AI systems developed and deployed by tech corporations as separate in any way from these corporations, or as “autonomous” entities that need rights, is not ethics — it is irresponsible and harmful to vulnerable groups of human beings."
   - [Saudi Arabia’s robot citizen is eroding human rights](https://qz.com/1205017/saudi-arabias-robot-citizen-is-eroding-human-rights/)
      - Criticizing women’s rights in Saudi Arabia
      - “Naming Sophia a citizen creates a huge void in legal systems around the world, damages public understanding of AI, and fundamentally damages the very notion of human rights itself.”
      - Instances of AI systems displaying racism and sexism
      - Sophia’s right to self-determination?
      - “To be citizen means something, and that something means less now that it includes Sophia.”
   - [Pretending to give a robot citizenship helps no one](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/30/16552006/robot-rights-citizenship-saudi-arabia-sophia)
      - “Basically the entire legal notion of personhood breaks down.”
- *AI should not be given its own personhood for philosophical and ethical reasons.*
