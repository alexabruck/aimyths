_This bibliography was primarily compiled by Rachel Jang as part of a project for the Harvard Law School Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. Further edits were made by Daniel Leufer._

Here we've put together some resources on different topics around AI and agency, and added some annotations to give you a general idea about the different resources.

We've also put together some resources that explain the fundamental concepts underlying a lot of these debates:

### Legal Personhood
- [“Legal Person”](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/legal_person)
  - Legal person refers to a human or non-human entity that is treated as a person for legal purposes.
  - Typically, a legal person can sue and be sued, own property, and enter into contracts.
- [“What is Legal Personhood?”](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-78881-4_2)
  - Identified with the capability of holding rights and duties, the ability to bear responsibility.
  - Designated by the law as right-holders.
- [The Implications of Modern Business-Entity Law for the Regulation of Autonomous Systems](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2758222)
  - Shawn Bayern argued that AI systems could effectively be given legal personhood under the current U.S. law.
  - Although nonhuman autonomous systems are not legal persons under current law, the history of organizational law demonstrates that agreements can direct the actions of legal persons. Legally enforceable agreements can give legal effect to an algorithm or other process, so autonomous systems may be able to emulate many of the private-law rights of legal persons.
  - Modern business-entity statues, particularly LLC statues, can give software the basic capabilities of legal personhood.
- [Are Autonomous Entities Possible?](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3410395)
  - Shawn Bayern responds to reactions to previous paper.
  - The purpose of this paper is to rebut the criticisms and to suggest that Bayern’s reading of the LLC statutes is correct.
  - Describes the workability of LLCs without ongoing human internal governance.
  - Demonstrates that autonomous entities are legally sound under current statutes.
- [Legal Personhood for Artificial Intelligences](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1108671)
  - Paper written in 1992.
  - Describes what AI is, what legal personhood is.
  - Thought experiment in certain scenarios, raising legal questions.
- [Machine Minds: Frontiers in Legal Personhood](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2563965)
  - Personhood exists to protect conscious individuals from suffering and allow them exercise their wills, subject to their intelligence.
  - At some point, we will have to address the issue of consciousness in the law.
- [The boundaries of legal personhood: how spontaneous intelligence can problematise differences between humans, artificial intelligence, companies and animals](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10057241/1/Burgess_The%20boundaries%20of%20legal%20personhood_AOP.pdf)

### Patent
- [Drafting Patent Applications Covering Artificial Intelligence Systems (American Bar Association)](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2018-19/january-february/drafting-patent-applications-covering-artificial-intelligence-systems/)
  - Write claims the patent office will consider “patent eligible.”
  - Write a patent application that describes a technological development.
- [EPO and UKIPO Refuse AI-Invented Patent Applications](https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2020/01/07/epo-ukipo-refuse-ai-invented-patent-applications/id=117648/)
   - Rejected Dabus AI’s patent application.
   - Article 81 of the European Patent Convention (EPC)
   - “The European patent application shall designate the inventor. If the applicant is not the inventor or is not the sole inventor, the designation shall contain a statement indicating the origin of the right to the European patent.”
   - Inventor has to be human.
   - UKIPO: “There appears to be no law that allows for the transfer of ownership of the invention from the inventor to the owner in this case, as the inventor itself cannot hold property.”
- [Can an AI be an inventor? Not yet.](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615020/ai-inventor-patent-dabus-intellectual-property-uk-european-patent-office-law/)
   - Patent law has very specific ways of assigning ownership: The inventor must be either the employee or the contractor of the parent company.
   - There is also the legal requirement that inventors be individuals and “natural persons.”
   - We’re nowhere near general artificial intelligence, so few people will believe that the AI is truly the inventor.
   - Being an inventor comes with certain responsibilities such as being able to enter into contracts and file lawsuits.
- [The USPTO wants to know if artificial intelligence can own the content it creates](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20961788/us-government-ai-copyright-patent-trademark-office-notice-artificial-intelligence)
- [United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published a notice seeking public comments about copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights issues that may be impacted by AI. – 13 questions total](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2019-10-30/pdf/2019-23638.pdf)
