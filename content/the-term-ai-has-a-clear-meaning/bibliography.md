Knowing your N-grams from your Eigenvectors might seem daunting at first, but we’ve compiled a list of useful resources here to guide you through this maze of definitions and technical terms. In addition to some articles and glossaries for beginners, we’ve listed some more technical resources, clear explainers, interactive courses and interesting articles on the topic of defining AI.

If we’ve missed out on a great resource, please drop us a line and we’ll check it out!
